# DFG Viewer Docker

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

* [Further information](#further-information)

## Prerequisites

Install Docker Engine
<https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>

Install Docker Compose
<https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

## Usage

Go to the directory where you've put `docker-compose.yml`.

Copy the environment file `.env.example` inside the directory and rename it to `.env`. Adjust the configuration of the respective service to suit your needs. The variables are marked with the prefix of the service e.g. `APP_` for our TYPO3 application with DFG-Viewer.

*It is recommended to adjust the password of the TYPO3 admin user `APP_T3_PASSWORD`, the database password `DB_PASSWORD` in general, especially in a productive environment.*

Download images and start all service containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

It may take about a minute for TYPO3 and the extension to be installed at the initial start.

The DFG Viewer instance can then be accessed under `localhost`.

*When running `docker compose up` all services e.g. DFG-Viewer (APP) and database (DB) in our `docker-compose.yml` will be started and each as separate Docker container.*

Stops all service containers

```bash
docker compose stop
```

Stops and remove all service containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Development

To build the image, a `build` folder with a subfolder `extension` must be added.

```bash
mkdir -p build/extensions
```

Then, the three extension repositories, [DFG Viewer](https://github.com/slub/dfg-viewer), [Kitodo.Presentation](https://github.com/kitodo/kitodo-presentation), [SLUB Digital Collections](https://github.com/slub/slub_digitalcollections), must be cloned into this folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slub/dfg-viewer build/extensions
git clone https://github.com/kitodo/kitodo-presentation build/extensions
git clone https://github.com/slub/slub_digitalcollections build/extensions
```

Adjust the `composer.json` files of the checkouts as follows.

`composer.json` of the [DFG Viewer](https://github.com/slub/dfg-viewer) checkout `build/extensions/dfg-viewer`:

```text
  ...
  "require": {
    ...
    "kitodo/presentation": "@dev"
    "slub/slub-digitalcollection": "@dev"
    ...
  },
  ...
```

`composer.json` of the [SLUB Digital Collections](https://github.com/slub/slub_digitalcollections) checkout `build/extensions/slub_digitalcollections`:

```text
  ...
  "require": {
    ...
    "kitodo/presentation": "@dev"
    ...
  },
  ...
```

Build the image.

*Ensure that the `.env` file has been created. It is recommended to adjust the password of the TYPO3 admin user `APP_T3_PASSWORD`, the database password `DB_PASSWORD` in general and the `APP_IMAGE` name for building custom images in `.env` file.*

```bash
docker compose build dfg-viewer-app
```

### Usage of 3D viewer integrations

*There are multiple ways to install the 3D viewer integration. The simplest is to upload the folder that is generated during the [viewer integration installation](https://github.com/slub/dlf-3d-viewers#installation). We have decided to provide an installation based on commands here.*

Once all containers have been started (see [Usage](#usage)), you can run following command:

```bash
docker exec -u root -i dfg-viewer-app-1 sh -c "\
apt-get update && apt-get install unzip \
&& wget "https://github.com/slub/dlf-3d-viewers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -O /tmp/dlf-3d-viewers.zip \
&& cd /var/www/html/dfg-viewer/public/fileadmin\
&& unzip /tmp/dlf-3d-viewers.zip\
&& mv dlf-3d-viewers-main dlf_3d_viewers\
&& rm /tmp/dlf-3d-viewers.zip\
&& sh dlf_3d_viewers/install.sh\
&& chown -R www-data:www-data dlf_3d_viewers"
```

The steps of this long command can also be executed individually:

1. Login into `dfg-viewer-app-1` container as root user.

    ```bash
    docker exec -u root -it dfg-viewer-app-1 bash
    ```

2. Install unzip command line tool.

    ```bash
    apt-get update && apt-get install unzip
    ```

3. Download the current state of main branch of repository [3D viewer integrations for DFG-Viewer](https://github.com/slub/dlf-3d-viewers) as zip file

    ```bash
    wget "https://github.com/slub/dlf-3d-viewers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -O /tmp/dlf-3d-viewers.zip
    ```

4. Navigate to `fileadmin` folder, unzip the zip file, rename unzipped folder to `dlf_3d_viewers` and remove zip file

    ```bash
    cd /var/www/html/dfg-viewer/public/fileadmin

    unzip /tmp/dlf-3d-viewers.zip

    mv dlf-3d-viewers-main dlf_3d_viewers

    rm /tmp/dlf-3d-viewers.zip
    ```

5. Download libraries and frameworks for each viewer integration

    ```bash
    sh dlf_3d_viewers/install.sh
    ```

6. Change owner of integration folder, subfolder and files

    ```bash
    chown -R www-data:www-data dlf_3d_viewers
    ```
